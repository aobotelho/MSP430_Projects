// MSP430 I2C Library
// 07/05/2012 by Mushfiq Sarker <mushfiqsarker@inventige.com>

// Easy to use functions for communication with any I2C enabled device.
// This is usable only with MSP430F series of microcontrollers.

// Changelog:
// ... - ongoing debug release

// NOTE: THIS IS ONLY A PARIAL RELEASE. THIS DEVICE CLASS IS CURRENTLY UNDERGOING ACTIVE
// DEVELOPMENT AND IS STILL MISSING SOME IMPORTANT FEATURES. PLEASE KEEP THIS IN MIND IF
// YOU DECIDE TO USE THIS PARTICULAR CODE FOR ANYTHING.
